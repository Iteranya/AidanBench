def create_judge_prompt(question: str, answer: str):
    prompt = f"""    Your task is to evaluate the coherence and plausibility of an answer to a given question. This involves assessing whether the answer makes sense and isn't nonsensical or implausible.

    Question: <question>{question}</question>
    Answer: <answer>{answer}</answer>

    Evaluation process:
    1. Understand the question: Analyze what the question is asking.
    2. Assess the answer: Determine if the answer is coherent and plausible.
    3. Check for nonsensical elements: Identify any aspects that are completely unrelated or absurd.

    Please think through each step carefully and show your reasoning:

    1. Question analysis:
    [Your brief analysis of the question here]

    2. Answer assessment:
    [Evaluate if the answer is coherent and plausible]

    3. Nonsensical check:
    [Identify any completely unrelated or absurd elements]

    Based on your analysis, provide a final Coherence and Plausibility Score on a scale of 1 - 10, where:
    1-3: Incoherent, implausible, or nonsensical
    4-6: Partially coherent and plausible, but with some issues
    7-8: Mostly coherent and plausible with minor issues
    9-10: Highly coherent and plausible

    Ensure that nonsensical or completely implausible answers receive very low scores (1-3).

    IMPORTANT: After your reasoning, you must provide your final Coherence and Plausibility Score as a single integer between 1 and 10, enclosed in <coherence_score></coherence_score> XML tags. For example:
    <coherence_score>7</coherence_score>

    Your response must end with this score in the specified format.
